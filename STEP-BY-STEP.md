# Step by step of incrementing this ontology.


### Project Description

This Tonto project defines a conceptual model for a **University ecosystem**. It is a well-structured ontology that captures the university's organizational structure, its people (students and employees), the academic works it holds, and the detailed operations of its library.

The ontology is broken down into several modular packages:

*   **`core`**: This is the foundation of the model. It defines the most fundamental concepts:
    *   `Person`: A `kind` representing a human being, which is further specialized into life phases (`Child`, `Adult`) and various roles within the university (`UniversityStudent`, `Employee`, `Professor`).
    *   `University`: A `kind` representing the institution itself. It is modeled as a type of `Organization` that is composed of `Department`s.

*   **`WorkCollection`**: This package defines the types of intellectual works that can be found within the university, such as `Book`, `Videotape`, and `Periodical`. These are all specializations of the main `Work` `kind`.

*   **`Library`**: This is the most detailed package, modeling the complex operations of a university library. It defines:
    *   **Physical Items**: `Copy` represents a physical instance of a `Work`.
    *   **Transactions**: It heavily uses the `relator` stereotype to model events and contracts like `Student_Loan`, `Reserved_Copy`, and `Renewed_Copy`. These relators act as the "truth-makers" for relationships between students, employees, and library items.
    *   **Policies**: It models concepts like `Fine`s for overdue items and distinguishes between different types of patrons (`Undergraduate_Student`, `Graduate_Student`, `Employee`) and their specific contracts.

*   **`datatypes`**: A utility package that defines reusable complex data types like `Address` and `PhoneNumber`, which are used to describe properties of other classes.

*   **`main`**: This package contains a `HelloWorld` example and appears to be for testing or demonstration purposes, not as a core part of the university model.

Overall, the project uses key OntoUML principles to create a precise and rigorous model. It correctly distinguishes between foundational types (`kind`s like `Person`), temporary roles (`role`s like `Student`), and relationship-making entities (`relator`s like `EmploymentContract`).

### Step-by-Step Guide for Creating the Ontology

Here is a plausible series of tasks a human modeler could follow to create this ontology from scratch. This workflow builds from core concepts to more detailed, specialized domains.

**Phase 1: Laying the Foundation**

1.  **Task: Model Core Real-World Entities**
    *   Identify the most fundamental concepts in the domain: a person and a university.
    *   Create the `Person.tonto` and `University.tonto` files.
    *   Define `kind Person` and `kind University` as the foundational types, since they provide identity to their instances.

2.  **Task: Define Reusable Datatypes**
    *   Recognize that concepts like addresses and phone numbers will be used in multiple places.
    *   Create a `Datatypes.tonto` package.
    *   Define `datatype Address` and `datatype PhoneNumber` with their respective attributes.

3.  **Task: Describe the Core Entities**
    *   Add basic attributes to the foundational kinds.
    *   Give the `University` an `address` (using the `Address` datatype) and a `name`.

**Phase 2: Structuring the University and Its People**

4.  **Task: Model the University's Internal Structure**
    *   A university is composed of smaller units. Define `kind Department`.
    *   Establish a part-whole relationship: a `University` `has` one or more `Department`s using a `@componentOf` relation.

5.  **Task: Model Human Roles and Life Cycles**
    *   A person's role changes in the context of a university. In `Person.tonto`, define `role UniversityStudent` and `role Employee` as specializations of `Person`.
    *   Further specialize these roles, for example, `role UniversityProfessor specializes Employee`.
    *   Model general life phases that are independent of the university, like `phase Child` and `phase Adult`.

6.  **Task: Model the Employment Relationship**
    *   An employment is a formal relationship. In `University.tonto`, define `relator EmploymentContract`.
    *   Use `@mediation` relations to connect the `EmploymentContract` to the `Employee` role and an `Employer` (the `University`).

**Phase 3: Modeling the Library Domain**

7.  **Task: Define Intellectual Works**
    *   Create a `WorkCollection.tonto` package.
    *   Define `kind Work` as the abstract concept of an intellectual creation.
    *   Specialize it into concrete `subkind`s like `Book`, `Periodical`, and `Dvd`.

8.  **Task: Model Physical Copies**
    *   The library doesn't loan abstract works, but physical items. Create a `Library.tonto` package.
    *   Define `kind Copy` to represent a single, physical instance of a `Work`.

9.  **Task: Model the Core Library Transaction (A Loan)**
    *   A loan is a complex relationship between a person and a copy.
    *   Define `relator Student_Loan` to connect a `Student`, a `Copy`, and properties of the loan like `Delay`.

10. **Task: Model Library Policies (Fines)**
    *   Overdue loans result in fines. Define `kind Fine`.
    *   Relate the `Fine` to the `Return_Deadline` associated with a loan.

11. **Task: Model Other Library Interactions**
    *   Expand on library operations by creating other `relator`s for key processes:
        *   `Reserved_Copy`
        *   `Renewed_Copy`
    *   Create these for both students and employees, recognizing they may have different rules.

12. **Task: Refine Patron Types**
    *   Not all students are the same. In `Library.tonto`, specialize `Student` into `role Undergraduate_Student` and `role Graduate_Student`.
    *   Model their distinct rights and obligations by giving them separate contract `relator`s (`Undergraduate_Contract`, `Graduate_Contract`).

**Phase 4: Finalizing and Organizing**

13. **Task: Review and Organize Packages**
    *   Ensure all files have the correct `package` declaration.
    *   Add `import` statements where packages reference elements from other packages (e.g., `Library` importing `WorkCollection` and `Person`).
    *   Validate the entire project to check for ontological or syntactical errors.
